# Statistical Assessment of the Impact of Covid-19 on the Stock Performances for Four Large Application Monitoring Companies 

## Objective

This capstone aims to analyze the relative stock performances of four large application monitoring companies ([Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/), [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com), [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/)) and explore who is gaining most as we are adjusting to the post-covid world. 



## Introduction

Internet service disruptions, especially site loading delays, 404 erros and others, are a major issue for consumes and enterprises, alike.  With increased footprint of online workplace following <b>Covid</b>, service disruptions have become more frequent and longer. It seems the service monitoring companies are benefiting from this trend, going by their stock performances ([Splunk Stock](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=fin&sxsrf=ALeKk02Uh5eiv9qdTCusgE160E8P5bGsWw:1595479080419&q=NASDAQ:+SPLK&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDZOSTc0LcuPNeRax8vg5Brs4BlopBAf4eAMA3qoDpUwAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3t9bexuLqAhXlLX0KHcnnDkYQ3ecFMAB6BAgvEBM&biw=1920&bih=969#scso=_LRQZX7m-EYq10PEP-ZqbmAk1:0), [Datadog Stock](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=fin&sxsrf=ALeKk00Ihr9BF2iwnPYR-HqMNTVyx-xqMQ:1595036432459&q=NASDAQ:+DDOG&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDTNSKpMsyo0reRax8vg5Brs4BlopuLj4uwMAvo1YEEwAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjejdff1dXqAhX5CTQIHYeeCUcQ3ecFMAB6BAgnEBM&biw=1920&bih=969&dpr=2#scso=_KlMSX_WfFJ2_0PEP_rSr2Ak1:0&wptab=OVERVIEW), [New Relic Stock](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1920&bih=969&tbm=fin&sxsrf=ALeKk01RFyfTYoHCK3bc7KJ4UJvf-grQQA%3A1595036458339&ei=KlMSX_WfFJ2_0PEP_rSr2Ak&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDZOSTYuzCpOKeQCmvyz6PQAAAA&q=NYSE%3A+NEWR&oq=New+relic&gs_l=finance-immersive.1.0.81l2.56294.67618.0.68967.17.17.0.0.0.0.152.1688.6j10.16.0....0...1.1.64.finance-immersive..1.15.1588.0...0.q_WU8NmPGHA#scso=_cFMSX9HUHKSx0PEPxNyJoAY1:0), [Dynatrace Stock](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1920&bih=969&tbm=fin&sxsrf=ALeKk016Zg4oPACGZBdo5bIm4c0oHp93Mg%3A1595036528477&ei=cFMSX9HUHKSx0PEPxNyJoAY&q=NYSE%3A+DY&oq=NYSE%3A+DY&gs_l=finance-immersive.3..81l3.41202.43033.0.43381.6.6.0.0.0.0.112.586.3j3.6.0....0...1.1.64.finance-immersive..0.6.584....0.VHJFwHMrLNo#scso=_nVMSX5uOBZLV9AOtpb2IDw1:0)). 

## Stationarity Testing

A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation, etc. are all constant over time. Most statistical methods are based on the assumption that the time series can be rendered approximately stationary (i.e., "stationarized") through the use of mathematical transformations. This particular study uses first order percentage difference as the transformation. Subsequently, the Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller (ADF) test is used with the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in an autoregressive model. The alternative hypothesis is that time series is trend-stationarity. In this study, time series seasonality has not been dicussed because a relatively short time window, _120 days_, was examined in this study. 

## Hypothesis Testing Methodology

A Frequestist hypothesis testing methodology will be used. It entails following steps:

* Asking a close-ended question where answers should be one of the two mutually exclusive statements.
  * Null: Covid-19 has no impact on stock performance.
  * Alternative: Covid-19 has impact on stock performance.
  
* Choose an appropriate level of significance 
  * \alpha = 0.05 (following the convention)
  
* Choose a statistical test and find the test statistic
  * t because this study involves time series data which does not follow _i.i.d_ and it is difficult to assess the underlying distrinution. 
  
* Compute the probability of null hypothesis is true
  * p-value
  ```
   scipy.stats.ttest_ind(a, b, axis=0, equal_var=False, nan_policy='propagate')
  ```
* Compare p-value with \alpha to draw a conclusion:
  * if p<= $\alpha$, Reject Null in favor of Alternative
  * if p> $\alpha$, Fail to reject Null _w.r.t_ Alternative


A Bayesian testing will be used in addition to cross-examine the conclusion drawn from Frequestist method. The Bayesian A/B testing will be used to examine month-over-month evolution of stock price for the companies. 


## Data 

The time series stock data used in this capstone was collected from [Yahoo Finance Website](https://finance.yahoo.com/). The stock data is compiled over a year starting from July 20, 2020. Yahoo! Finance records stock data every business data at 9:30AM (EST), 4PM (EST). In addition to these two datapoints, daily highest and lowest stock prices are also noted. 

### Raw Data

![](./figures/splunk_candlestick.png)
---
![](./figures/heatmap.png )
---
For this analysis, stock close price($) was considered to be the key metric. 



### Transformed Data 

* Change the index to data
* Add four different columns
   * Diff: First order rowwise difference 
   * <b>Pct_Diff: Daily Percentage Diff _w.r.t._ Previous Day</b>
   * Normalized_Close: Close _w.r.t._ Close on March 16, 2020
   * Normalized_Diff: Diff _w.r.t_ Diff on March 16, 2020
* Added four date attributes to the original class
   * start_date='2019-07-23'
   * moveback_date='2019-10-15' (5 months back to March 16, 2020)
   * reference_date='2020-03-16' 
   * current_date='2020-07-20' (data collection date)
* Drop the first row with Null
* Two sub-samples from the dataset has been picked out, One from <b>10/15/19-03/16/20</b> and another from <b>03/17/20-07/20/20</b>, because we want to compare stock performance before and after 03/16/20

## Baseline Study

First a baseline study has been performed with the S&P 500 data with the same timeframe. The S&P 500 is a stock market metric that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices, and is regarded as one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market. This baseline study pertains to the validity of the null hypothesis that Covid has no statistically significant impact on the stock price. For this Hypothesis testing, two samples of the data drawn from the original 1 yr. long data corpus. One dataset spans from <b>Oct 15, 2019-March 16, 2020</b> and another spans from <b>March 17, 2020-July 20, 2020</b>.

| ----------|:----------:|
| t_stat    |  -1.663    |  
| p_value   |   0.097    |   


Because p_value > 0.05, the Null hypothesis can not be rejected _w.r.t_ the Alternative hypothesis. It means we can conclude that Covid-19 has no impact on S&P 500 stock performance. 




## Exploratory Data Analysis

For this EDA, stock closing price has been considered as the core metric for the sake of brevity. 

![](./figures/comparison.png )

---
The chart suggests the time seris data is hardly stationary with time varying properties. That is why we performed the percentage difference operation on stock close price. Henceforth, we will be using <b>Pct_Diff</b> as our experimental variable.  

#### Stationarity Testing 

First, we performed ADF stationarity testing on the Pct_Diff values for all companies and compile following startistical parameter values. It can be observed that except for Splunk during 10/15/19-03/16/20, all time series segments are stationary.

The stationarity of the time series segements could be further evaluated from the follow control chart of Pct_Diff. The solid horizontal line is the sample mean and two vertical line together represent 99% confidence interval.

#### Statistical Analysis

<!-- ![](./figures/before_after_Histogram_Normalized_Diff.png) -->

The statistical properties of two time series sub-samples before and after March 16, 2020 are computed and listed in the following table. In addition to traditional statistical properties, such as mean, standard deviation, and standard error, we also compute <b>Risk Fraction</b> which is defined as the the number of positive points in the sample. Since the statistic deals with Daily % Change, Rise Fraction inform how many positive changes has happened in a sample space. 


|           |               |     Splunk    |     Datadog   |   Dynatrace   |   New Relic  | 
|-----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|--------------|
|10/15/19-  | Mean          |  -0.228    |  -0.039    |   0.008   |  -0.222   |
|03/16/20    | Std. Dev.     |   4.612    |   1.699    |    1.101   |   1.781   |
|           | Std. Error    |0.45|0.166|0.107|0.174|
|           | Rise Fraction   |0.53|0.50|0.51|0.47|
|03/17/20-      | Mean          |1.28|0.733|0.275|0.326|
|07/20/20    | Std. Dev.     |5.582|2.727|1.263|1.983|
|           | Std. Error    |0.598|0.292|0.135|0.213|
|           | Rise Fraction       |0.63|0.67|0.62|0.55|

The following distribution shows cumulative sum of % daily change. The red scatter plot observed to have around 10% more positve points that means <b>in general companies see more better stock performacne after 03/16/20</b>.

## Hypothesis Testing for the Stock Performances of Monitoring Companies

While a general observation was made that the stock performance is better 03/16/20, it is important to assess the statisitcal significance of these observation. That entails examination of our null hypothesis that there has been not impact on stock performance due to Covid. 

#### Frequentist Hypothesis Testing 

A t-test was performed based on the function mentioned in the Methodology section. 


|               |     Splunk    |     Datadog   |   Dynatrace   |   New Relic  | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|--------------|
| t_stat        |  -2.014599    |  -2.298923    |   -1.544077   |  -1.998822   |
| p_value       |   0.045       |   0.023       |    0.124      |   0.047      |

With this t-test, following conclusions could be drawn:

* Except for Dynatrace, all monitoring companies are doing better after 03/16/20

* Datadog appears to be gaining most

* Dynatrace is lagging behind

* New Relic and Splunk are doing OK.

* Supporting ground Truth: Datadog has been a top-performing stock in Q2 [Link](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/04/why-datadog-stock-surged-22-in-june.aspx)
   
* Possible Cause: Covid has driven a increase in online workplace. It means there is a increase need for cloud computing, as evident from the massive growth of GCP, Azure, and AWS in Q2-20. With cloud computing, there is an increased need for real-time monitoring of cloud resources. Datadog fits that bill perfectly. Dynatrace, on the other hand, focused mostly on traditonal code-level monitoring. A code-level monitoring solution not critical important as cloud resource monitoring in the present scheme of things.  
   


#### Bayesian Testing 

##### Comparsion between (10/15/19-03/16/20) and (03/17/19-07/20/20)

The result from a Bayesian A/B testing is shown in the following chart.  

![](./figures/bayesian_test.png)

Following conclusions can be drawn:

* All companies have right shifted left area which can be corroborated to the general observation that the stock performance has seen some improvement after March 16, 2020. 
* Datadog has least overlaps between blue and red regions. That validates our observation from the t-test. 
*  What is confounding that Dynatrace seems to have a considerably lower overlap. It could be attributed to sampling error or out of distribution issues. We made somewhat weak assumption that each daily % change is not impacted by the previous daily % change. A further examination is needed to ensure greater precision.


### Monthly Evoluton of Stock Prices After March 16, 2020

The result from a month-over-month Bayesian A/B testing is shown in the following chart.  

Legends:

* Red Line: Mid March-April
* Violet Line: Mid April-May
* Green Line: Mid May-June
* Yellow Line: Mid June-July

![](./figures/monthly_evolution.png)


Following conclusions can be drawn:

* <b>Splunk:</b> After relative slow growth in previous two months, Splunk had rapid growth from Mid May-June. However, their growth dramatically slow down in July. 

* <b>Datadog:</b> Datadog made a massive progress from Mid April-May. However, since June, their growhth has slow down. 

* <b>Dynatrace:</b> Dynatrace made a some progress from Mid April-May. However, their growth rate is slowly declining. 

* <b>New Relic:</b> New Relic made a moderate progress from Mid April-May. However, their growth rate is gradually declining. 

----

## General Conclusion

It seems monitoring stock is performing before after March 16, 2020. The background study suggests the growth of cloud computing and the rise of monitoring need are possible reasons behind the trend. However, the month-by-month Bayesian A/B testing suggests that monitoring companies are slowling losing momentum they have in April-May. In fact, a recent dip in Datadog stock on July 22, 2020 is concerning. [Link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/datadog-ddog-stock-sinks-market-214509758.html) 


## Recommendation

*  Monitoring companies are, in general, doing better. They are good bets for investments. 
*  Datadog must not lose the momentum they gain due to rapid rise of cloud computing following the pandemic. Although they have strong Q2, their stock performance is dwindling in July. 
*  Dynatrace must reinvest themselves and focus on cloud monitoring more to respond to the change in the market.
