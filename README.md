# capstone-1

## Objective

The objective of this capstone 1 is to utilize the EDA, statistical analyses, and big data skills and extract meaningful insight from publicly available dataset.

## Introduction

Service disruptions, especially site loading delays, 404 erros and others, are a major issue for consumes and enterprises, alike. Together they lead to $100B annual loss, on avaerage, from lost revenue, traffic attrition, and lost productiviity. There are some wesbites like  
![downdetector.com](https://downdetector.com/ "downdetector.com") which document major incidents every day. A large number of incidents necessiates the need for using data analysis for extracting actionable insight about the distribution of the incidents across the enterprises and duration. 

## Data 

I am intending to scrap internet. Two great sources of data are (downdetector.com)[https://downdetector.com/] API and Google API. I need to explore if Downdetector a bit to see if I can scarp data from them. I have scrap Google API before. 

* I will try figure out the feasibility of the data sources over the weekend. As a backup, I will have to have to use ![Google Data Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ "datasetsearch.research.google.com/")
