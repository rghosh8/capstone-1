## Data 

I am intending to scrap internet to compile stock prices for monitoring solutions.  

## Data Analysis



---

My null hypothesis (H0) will be that Covid does not have any impact on the sales of monitoring solution. My alternative hypothesis (H0) will be that Covid does have any impact on the sales of monitoring solution.



## Conclusion

* Answer if Covid indeed affected the sales of monitoring solutions with stock price being the metric.
* Answer who is gaining/losing most among the Big-3.
